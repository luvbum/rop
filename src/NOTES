TODO:

1: Actor input
Shall return the input key as a char and then interpreted in the Update function.

2: Map
Map shall contain Rooms,
a room is just defined as a 2D array as a 2D matrix, starting from x1,y1 to x2,y2.
Within the array, basic representation of the tiles, in number or character form.

The tiles will then be used to generate map objects, maybe actors(?), that will be containing the graphics, functionallity etc of each tile.

3: Player vs Map
The player will need to be able to interact with the map, collision detection.
Will this be simple if the map is just an array of actors? Should probably contain the map data in something other than actors, perhaps a new kind of object that can be composed of some of the actors features.
